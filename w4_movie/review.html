                <p>The movie was a big insporation for me growing up allowing me to make connections with people no matter their back story or where they came from. Having an open heart to lend a hand even when you yourself are not ready can lead to healing not only the person you are helping but also making you feel closure yourself. The music provided by the great artist Phil Collins only added to the magical feeling of every moment that came with the movie, further cementing the feelings that were being bestowed at such a younger age. I've watched the movie over A THOUSAND TIMES over the past 2 decades and enjoyed every single moment even at my current age.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>Overall I feel as though this is a movie that should be watched no matter what generation you come from. Why you may ask? Well that's simple, The emotions and heart that the movie has can give anyone a touch of the heart and maybe even cry like a baby at some parts. The love and growth the movie shows between the characters can really hit home almost as if you're watching your own family story being told for all to see. Giving the viewer a new perspective of their curret situation. LONG LIVE TARZAN!</p>
